_Example of JS-Fiddle style workflow on localhost_

### Setup
Assuming you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed on your Mac, you can
just clone this repo and run `make` -- brew will install all dependencies
for you, and then start a livereload server and open your browser to the right
spot.


### FAQ

#### Why did you do this?
It's an experiment to see if a workflow exists that is comparably ergonomic to
JS Fiddle, but is also amenable to working in version control.
